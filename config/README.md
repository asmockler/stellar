# Project Config

This folder is dedicated to files that help configure the project.

## API Tokens: `secrets.js`

You will need a few API tokens and passwords and you should store them in this folder in a file called `secrets.js`. It will look _something_ like this:

```javascript
export const AUTH_TOKEN = 'super-secret-slack-api-bot-key'
export const OUTGOING_WEBHOOK_TOKEN = 'SecretOutgoingWebhookToken'
```
